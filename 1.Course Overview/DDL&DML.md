# 📘 Data Definition Language (DDL) in DBMS

## 🔹 What is DDL?
DDL (**Data Definition Language**) is a subset of SQL used to **define, modify, and remove database structures** such as:
- Databases
- Tables
- Views
- Indexes
- Constraints  

👉 DDL deals with the **structure (schema)** of the database, not the data itself.  
👉 All DDL commands are **auto-committed**, meaning changes are permanent and cannot be rolled back in most DBMS.

---

## 🔹 Common DDL Commands

### 1. CREATE
- Used to **create new database objects** (databases, tables, views, indexes).

**Syntax:**
 
CREATE DATABASE dbname;

CREATE TABLE tablename (
    column_name datatype [constraints],
    ...
);
Example:


-- Create a new database
CREATE DATABASE UniversityDB;

-- Create a new table
CREATE TABLE Student (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    Age INT,
    Email VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Create a view
CREATE VIEW StudentView AS
SELECT Name, Age FROM Student;
2. **ALTER**
- Used to modify the structure of an existing database object.

- Syntax & Examples:

-- Add a new column
ALTER TABLE Student ADD COLUMN Address VARCHAR(100);

-- Modify column datatype
ALTER TABLE Student MODIFY COLUMN Age SMALLINT;

-- Drop a column
ALTER TABLE Student DROP COLUMN Email;

-- Rename a table
ALTER TABLE Student RENAME TO StudentInfo;
3. **DROp**
- Used to **delete** database objects permanently.
⚠️ Caution: All data and structure are lost permanently.

- Syntax & Examples:

-- Drop a table
DROP TABLE Student;

-- Drop a database
DROP DATABASE UniversityDB;

-- Drop a view
DROP VIEW StudentView;
4. **TRUNCATE**
- Used to delete all rows in a table but keeps the table structure.

- Faster than DELETE because it resets storage.

- Usually cannot be rolled back.

- Example:

TRUNCATE TABLE Student;
5. **RENAME**
- Used to rename a database object.

- Example:

 
-- Rename a table
- RENAME TABLE Student TO StudentInfo;
- 🔹 Key Points about DDL
- DDL commands affect the schema, not the data.

- Auto-commit: Most DDL commands are committed automatically.

- Cannot rollback (depends on DBMS).

- Used during database design and setup.

🔹 Quick Comparison Table
Command	Purpose	Example

CREATE	  | Create database, table, view, or index	CREATE TABLE Student (...)
ALTER	  | Modify database object structure	ALTER TABLE Student ADD COLUMN Email VARCHAR(50)
DROP	  | Delete database object permanently	DROP TABLE Student
TRUNCATE | 	Delete all rows from a table	TRUNCATE TABLE Student
RENAME	  | Rename a database object	RENAME TABLE Student TO StudentInfo

✅ Summary
- DDL defines and manages schema/structure.

- Commands include: CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, RENAME.

- Changes are usually permanent (auto-commit).

- Essential during initial database design and schema updates.



# 📘 Data Manipulation Language (DML)

## 🔹 What is DML?
DML (**Data Manipulation Language**) is a subset of SQL used to **work with the data stored in database objects** like tables.  
- While **DDL** changes the **structure (schema)**,  
- **DML** changes the **data inside the structure**.  

👉 DML allows you to **insert, update, delete, and retrieve** data.  

---

## 🔹 Connection Between SQL and DML
- **SQL (Structured Query Language)** is the **umbrella language** used in relational databases.  
- DML is a **part of SQL**, just like DDL.  
- In other words:  

SQL = DDL + DML + DCL + TCL + DQL

 

Where:  
- **DDL** → Structure (CREATE, ALTER, DROP)  
- **DML** → Data (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)  
- **DQL** → Queries (SELECT – sometimes considered part of DML)  
- **DCL** → Security (GRANT, REVOKE)  
- **TCL** → Transactions (COMMIT, ROLLBACK)  

---

## 🔹 Types of DML
1. **Procedural DML**  
   - The user specifies **what data is needed** and **how to get it**.  
   - More detailed, often used in programming languages.  

2. **Non-Procedural DML** (most common in SQL)  
   - The user specifies **what data is needed**, not how.  
   - Example:  
   
   SELECT Name FROM Student WHERE Age > 18;
🔹 DML Commands
1. **INSERT**
- Used to add new records into a table.

Syntax:
 
INSERT INTO table_name (col1, col2, col3, ...)
VALUES (val1, val2, val3, ...);
Example:
 
INSERT INTO Student (StudentID, Name, Age, Email)
VALUES (101, 'Alice', 20, 'alice@email.com');
2. **UPDATE**
- Used to modify existing records in a table.

Syntax:
 
- UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
Example:

 
- UPDATE Student
SET Age = 21, Email = 'alice21@email.com'
WHERE StudentID = 101;
⚠️ If WHERE is not used, all rows are updated.

3. **DELETE**
- Used to remove existing records from a table.

Syntax:
 
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
Example:

DELETE FROM Student WHERE StudentID = 101;
⚠️ If WHERE is not used, all rows are deleted.

4. **SELECT** (DQL, but often treated as DML)
- Used to retrieve records from a table.

Syntax:
 
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
Example:
 
SELECT Name, Age FROM Student WHERE Age > 18;
🔹 Key Points about DML
- DML works on data inside tables, not the schema.

- Requires careful use of WHERE to avoid unwanted changes/deletions.

- DML operations can be controlled with TCL (COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT).

- DML is most frequently used by developers and users in day-to-day database operations.

🔹 Quick Comparison Table
- Command	Purpose	Example
-- INSERT	Add new records	INSERT INTO Student VALUES (101,'Alice',20)
-- UPDATE	Modify existing records	UPDATE Student SET Age=21 WHERE StudentID=101
-- DELETE	Remove records	DELETE FROM Student WHERE StudentID=101
-- SELECT	Retrieve records (query data)	SELECT * FROM Student

✅ Summary
- DML = Part of SQL focused on data.

- Commands: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and SELECT.

- SQL connects with DML as its sub-language for data operations.

- Unlike DDL, DML changes can be rolled back using TCL commands.

 
### Two classes of Language 

1. **Pure**= used for providing properties about computational power and optimizational 

     - Relational algebra 
     - Tuple relational calculus
    - Domain Relational

2. **Commertial** - used in commertial systums
    - SQL is most widly used as commertial language
    

# 📘 Structured Query Language (SQL)

## 🔹 What is SQL?
- **SQL** = Structured Query Language.  
- It is the **standard language** for managing and manipulating **relational databases (RDBMS)**.  
- SQL allows us to:  
  - Define the database structure (tables, schema)  
  - Insert, update, delete, and query data  
  - Control access and transactions  

👉 SQL is a **declarative language** → You tell **what** you want, not **how** to do it.

---

## 🔹 Why SQL?
- Universal language supported by almost all DBMS (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, SQLite).  
- SQL is not a Turing machine equivalent language
- Simple to learn, yet powerful.  
- Works with **small apps (SQLite)** to **enterprise-level systems (Oracle, PostgreSQL)**.  

---

## 🔹 Categories of SQL Commands
SQL is divided into **five main categories**:  

| Category | Full Form | Purpose | Examples |
|----------|-----------|---------|----------|
| **DDL** | Data Definition Language | Defines structure of DB objects | `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `TRUNCATE` |
| **DML** | Data Manipulation Language | Work with the data itself | `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` |
| **DQL** | Data Query Language | Retrieve data from DB | `SELECT` |
| **DCL** | Data Control Language | Control permissions/security | `GRANT`, `REVOKE` |
| **TCL** | Transaction Control Language | Manage transactions | `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT` |

---

## 🔹 Basic Structure of SQL
### Database Objects
- **Tables** → Store data in rows and columns.  
- **Views** → Virtual tables (based on queries).  
- **Indexes** → Improve search performance.  
- **Schemas** → Logical grouping of tables & objects.  

### Syntax Rules
- SQL is **not case-sensitive** (`SELECT` = `select`).  
- Statements end with a **semicolon (;)**.  
- Strings are enclosed in `'single quotes'`.  
- SQL follows **set theory** (operations are on sets of rows).
